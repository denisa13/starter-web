English is the largest language by number of speakers,[13] and the third most-spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.
[14] It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states.
 There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. As of 2005, it was estimated that there were over 2 
 billion speakers of English.[15] English is the majority native language in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and 
 Ireland, an official and the main language of Singapore, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, 
 and Oceania.[16] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations.
 It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English speakers are called 
 "Anglophones". There is much variability among the many accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions—in terms of phonetics 
 and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, idioms, grammar, and spelling— but it does not typically prevent understanding by speakers of other 
 dialects and accents, although mutual unintelligibility can occur at extreme ends of the dialect continuum.
